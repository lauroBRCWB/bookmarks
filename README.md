> - What kills me makes other stronger. (...) The people think that what did not kill me, makes me stronger. And I'm saying this is wrong. It's typically because it's a selection effect, not the improvement. Let me go through the history of mistakes made with fragility. (...) So when someone says, "what didn't kill me, made me stronger" could often be that it killed the others that were weaker. And therefore I have the illusion I'm stronger, but in fact the others are weaker.
